<h1>COMP2084 - Final Project - Tipsy Tasty Web App</h1>
<p>This site uses .NET Core 5.0 and will be my final project for Server-Side Scripting at Georgian College in the Summer 2021 Semester.</p>
<p>It will provide the user with an interface to log any spirits they are enoying, or have enjoyed in the past, and share them with the community of users by provided feedback about ratings, local pricing and tasting notes</p>
